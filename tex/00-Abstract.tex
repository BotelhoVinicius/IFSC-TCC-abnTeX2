		This papper presents the study of electromagnetic compatibility techniques to reduce conducted and irradiated noise in a Buck Interleaved static converter. The proposed converter project had started in the Power Electronics discipline and has an output current of \SI{5}{\ampere}, an output voltage of \SI{5}{\volt} and a 25 watts of nominal power. In this work, the conducted and radiated emission tests of the designed converter were carried out, as well as the tests after the application of the proposed techniques, applied in isolation. In order to be possible to compare the results of the tests, a standardization of the tests was established, related to the position of the board and the cable. Among the proposed tests, some stood out for presenting significant results. A great solution presented was the reduction of the switching frequency with the use of a three-state switching cell converter. The techniques tested in isolation didn't show significant improvements simultaneously in the conducted and irradiated emission, however, when used in combination, they proved to be of great efficiency.
